# Real-Time-Remote-Health-Monitoring-System

With the advent of IoT, we can provide remote healthcare to patients who have been diagnosed with life-threatening diseases.

Patient Health Monitoring, we Develoed an IoT solution to provide remote, real-time body health monitoring that will continuously measure the heart rate and body temperature of the patient who is at risk of suffering from brain haemorrhage. To achieve this, we will:
a) Digitally process the heart rate and body temperature (using Arduino) which will be detected using a pulse sensor and LM-35 sensor, respectively.
b) Send the readings to the cloud using a Wi-Fi module, i.e., ESP8266 through the Arduino and use ThinkSpeak as our cloud service.
c) Design an app for the user which will help them to know their vital readings and monitor their health accordingly.
